            <h2>007 Elements</h2>
            <h3>Sölden, Austria</h3>
            <p>
              The Red Dot design award-winning installation touts itself as the world's first cinematic installation dedicated to the the world of James Bond.
            </p>
            <p>
              Set on the summit of Gaislachkogl Mountain, fans will recognize the location as the Hoffler Klinik where Bond meets Dr. Madeleine Swann in "Spectre" from 2015.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h2>Piz Gloria</h2>
            <h3>Bernese Oberland, Switzerland</h3>
            <p>
              Another snow-capped getaway is on the Schilthorn in Switzerland. Reached by cable car, the rotating restaurant was heavily featured in George Lazenby's only Bond film "On Her Majesty's Secret Service."
            </p>
            <p>
              The restuarant features a Bond exhibition as well as a "007 Walk of Fame." The 6th film in the Bond series celebrated it's 50th anniversary in 2019.

            <h2>James Bond Island</h2>
            <h3>Phang Nga Bay, Thailand</h3>
            <p>
              Also known as Khao Ta Pu (nail island in Thai), the island received its new title after a visit from Roger Moore in "The Man with the Golden Gun."
            </p>
            <p>
              The island's location in Ao Phang Nga Marine National Park doesn't allow boats to directly approach it but there are boat tours that allow for views of the unique shaped limestone.

            <h2>GoldenEye</h2>
            <h3>Oracabessa, Jamaica</h3>
            <p>
              Perhaps the ultimate Bond fan destination, GoldenEye lets fans visit where Bond began.
            </p>
            <p>
              GoldeneEye was the Jamaican estate of author and creator of James Bond, Ian Fleming. Fleming wrote some or all of every Bond novel from the estate on his storied golden typewritter. Now a hotel and resort, guests can enjoy gardens and private beaches.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be sure to pick up ornithological text "Guide to Birds of the West Indes" to help identify the feathered creatures of the area written by 007's namesake, James Bond.
